# Using Common Widgets

In this chapter, I learned how to effectively use a variety of common Flutter widgets to build dynamic and user-friendly interfaces. I explored the Scaffold widget, which provides the main structure for an app, along with the AppBar to display titles or navigation items at the top of the screen. The SafeArea widget ensures that content remains visible and is not hidden behind system UI elements like notches or screen cutouts. I also worked with the Container widget, which offers flexibility in styling and positioning elements, and the Text widget to display simple text. For more complex text formatting, I learned how to use RichText to display multi-style text within a single widget.

I gained experience with the Column and Row widgets, which are essential for creating vertical and horizontal layouts. By nesting these widgets, I was able to build more intricate and responsive UI designs that adjust to various screen sizes and orientations. The chapter also covered different types of buttons, including ElevatedButton and TextButton, which are used to trigger actions and allow for user interaction.

Additionally, I learned how to include visual elements such as images and icons using the Image and Icon widgets. I also explored how to enhance the appearance of widgets with decorators like borders and shadows. The TextField and TextFormField widgets were introduced, allowing me to retrieve and validate user input, which is key for creating interactive applications

Lastly, I learned how to check the appâ€™s orientation using the MediaQuery widget, ensuring that the layout adapts seamlessly between portrait and landscape modes. Overall, this chapter provided a solid understanding of how to create interactive and responsive Flutter applications by leveraging common widgets and best practices for UI design.
